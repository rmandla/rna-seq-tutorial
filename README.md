# RNA-seq Tutorial

This repo will contain a practice-based tutorial on analyzing RNA-seq data using edgeR.

## Pre-requisites

The following packages are essential for using this tutorial:

* R
* [edgeR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html)

### Optional

I recommend using Jupyter for your code, because of the ease of integrating documentation with code, and the easy visualization of data. Instructions for installing Jupyter can be found [here](https://jupyter.org/install) and instructions on using R with jupyter can be found [here](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/). 

Note that you do not need jupyter to follow along. If you don't have it, copy the code from the notebooks in this repo into R studio or whatever other environment you run R commands in.
